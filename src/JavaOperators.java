        Java Operators
        Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
        
            1. Arithmetic operators
            2. Assignment operators
            3. Comparison operators
            4. Logical operators
            5. Bitwise operators


        Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

            Operator	Name	        Description	                            Example
            +	        Addition	    Adds together two values	            x + y	
            -	        Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another	    x - y	
            *	        Multiplication	Multiplies two values	                x * y	
            /	        Division	    Divides one value by another	        x / y	
            %	        Modulus	        Returns the division remainder	        x % y	
            ++	        Increment	    Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
            --	        Decrement	    Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x


        Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
        
            Operator	Example	    Same As
            =	        x = 5	    x = 5	
            +=	        x += 3	    x = x + 3	
            -=	        x -= 3	    x = x - 3	
            *=	        x *= 3	    x = x * 3	
            /=	        x /= 3	    x = x / 3	
            %=	        x %= 3	    x = x % 3	
            &=	        x &= 3	    x = x & 3	
            |=	        x |= 3	    x = x | 3	
            ^=	        x ^= 3	    x = x ^ 3	
            >>=	        x >>= 3	    x = x >> 3	
            <<=	        x <<= 3	    x = x << 3


        Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

            Operator	Name	                    Example
            ==	        Equal to	                x == y	
            !=	        Not equal	                x != y	
            >	        Greater than	            x > y	
            <	        Less than	                x < y	
            >=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
            <=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y

        
        Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

            Operator	Name	        Description	                                                Example
            && 	        Logical and	    Returns true if both statements are true	                x < 5 &&  x < 10	
            || 	        Logical or	    Returns true if one of the statements is true	            x < 5 || x < 4	
            !	        Logical not	    Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	    !(x < 5 && x < 10)
